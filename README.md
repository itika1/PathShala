# Challenges I ran into
First of all I've worked on such a project which is based on Agora technology and I'm very noob in this technology like I've heard one or two times before start of this hackathon but haven't applied before. So, initially I found it very difficult and I got confused where to start from and how to proceed. Also, as I'm working solo in HTM hackathon ( https://hackthemountain.tech/ )so also I was pretty worried about it. But in the meantime the HTM team helped me a lot through discord server ( https://discord.hackthemountain.tech/ ). Though I know html, css, js, npm, nodejs, git pretty well so I didn't find so much difficulties to start with the project. I've got the tutorial, documentations from the mentors of HTM. Also some documents are also available at agora official website ( https://www.agora.io/en/ ) 
As I start doing work on project I got stuck in the build time. As the path variable was not all set. So first I set those and fix the issues. Then I code the webpack file which is very important as we are running files using webpack. Quickly I install all the dependencies and then install also live server. 
To import AgoraRTC module in the project I used the following code
import AgoraRTC from "agora-rtc-sdk-ng"
This is the way to test any agora sdk project. For that I ran 
1) npm run build
2) npm start run:dev 
Now I see that my project was running on the server. Then I go to my agora account and open my project that I've already built earlier. From there I copy the APP ID, Token and Channel Name which are needed to join a channel and then all done :)
Thanks to HTM team for supporting me and encouraging me to built a project with Agora.
